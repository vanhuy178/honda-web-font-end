People are satisfying their curiosities in the virtual world, which offers people greater freedom. A world where, for many people, mobility may not be as essential to sustaining a comfortable lifestyle is just around the corner.',
    'Even when such times come, Honda wants to continue expanding opportunities for people to enjoy the freedom of mobility so that everyone can fulfill their curiosities in the real world as well. The real world is where we experience things using our five senses, and we can demonstrate great sensitivity to enjoy vivid and colorful experiences and a sense of wonder which are different from the virtual world. We believe that expanding our own world while following our own curiosities is one of our natural and invaluable joys as human beings.',

To prevent collisions, it is necessary to understand that diverse elements make up the ever-changing traffic environment, such as roads, telecommunication infrastructure, automobiles and pedestrians, and their relationship in a dynamic traffic ecosystem to enable each element to connect organically. To contribute to the healthy functioning of the traffic ecosystem, Honda will maintain an open attitude and be proactive in technological development as well as other areas including cooperation with various countries and regions, and collaboration with other companies."

This is one example of the demonstration of a traffic culture, and such cultural elements can influence the occurrence of traffic collisions and people's desire for mobility.As it will become increasingly smoother and easier to communicate among people and vehicles with the advancement of smart infrastructure and mobility products, Honda will undertake initiatives to enhance the warmth and kindness demonstrated by everyone sharing the road and to establish a traffic culture where everyone enjoys safer mobility, with the desire to go more places."
