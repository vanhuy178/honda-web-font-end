            It was October 1946, in Hamamatsu, Japan, when Soichiro Honda took over a factory wartime bombings had left
            in
            ruins; determined to succeed post war he established the Honda Technical Research Institute. Soichiro's
            first
            attempt at manufacturing was the "rotary weaving machine"; then he tried his hand at mass-producing frosted
            glass windows. After failing to "take off", and not one to give up, he next tried manufacturing woven bamboo
            roof panels. Then Soichiro came across a surplus of two-stroke motors and had an idea. With very little
            gasoline
            available for transportation, Soichiro decided to build motorbikes. Soichiro started adapting the small
            2-cycle
            motorcycle engines to run on turpentine and attached them to cycle frames Hamamatsu factory workers built.
            The
            bikes were popular and soon sold out leading Soichiro to begin manufacturing his own engines; and the
            history of
            Honda began.

            When Soichiro Honda took over the factory in Hamamatsu, Japan in October 1946, he had big dreams of
            succeeding in the marketplace. Throughout the history of Honda, his name has surely surpassed his biggest
            expectations becoming an icon known to represent some of the best made and most trusted products worldwide.
